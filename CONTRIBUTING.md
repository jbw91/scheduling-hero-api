Any changes should be accompanied with quality unit tests. Pull requests with failed builds will not be accepted.

Commit messages should be descriptive of the change. (i.e. "a few small changes" is not a good commit message)

## Coding Conventions

Please do not change anything in the `.editorconfig`, `.jshintrc`, or any other coding style config files. A few specifics:

* We use tabs for indentation. No spaces/"soft" tabs.
* There should be a final newline in the file. (automatically done via the .editorconfig if you use an editor that supports this)
* Opening curly braces should **NOT** be on a new line.

Thanks so much for contributing!!!
